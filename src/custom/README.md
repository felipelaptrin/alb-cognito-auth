# Custom AWS Resources

This folder contains some Identity Center Custom Resources that are not being used in this project but I added here because I have hope that in a near future AWS Identity Center will be a true IdP that will support OIDC Authentication with Cognito + ALB.

You can ignore the entire content of this folder.
